# Data Normalisation

This module introduces learners to the concept of data normalisation, which is a process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called **normal forms** in order to reduce data **redundancy** and improve data **integrity**.

Each step is explained on how to reach 3rd Normal Form. We don't intend to go any further than that.
