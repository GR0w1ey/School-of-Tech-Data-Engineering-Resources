### Prep - AWS console and CLI setup

Depending on the programme being delivered, share the appropriate `aws-setup-*.md` file with the cohort:

| Academy                   | Setup File |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Generation                | [./handouts/aws-setup-sso.md](./handouts/aws-setup-sso.md) |
| School of Tech (Mac/Unix) | [./handouts/aws-setup-azure-login.md](./handouts/aws-setup-azure-login.md) |
| School of Tech (Windows)  | [./handouts/README-windows-setup-SoT](./handouts/README-windows-setup-SoT) |

These instructions are covered in the slides but are a useful addition.

- Make sure the slides for accessing AWS are up to date and match closely what you have to do - for example if Generation or a Client have updated anything recently, raise a PR to bring the slides in line
- Create the session files (pdf and zip) for distribution using `make generate-session-files f=module_name` or `make gsf-local f=module_name`

## Session

- Have your AWS console and CLI ready to use
- Run the slide deck
- When setting up access, give out the relevant handouts, as above
