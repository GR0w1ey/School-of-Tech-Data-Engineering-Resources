## Assessments

To check the learner progress in this session we have:

- Follow-along exercises to use the AWS CLI with CloudFormation templates
- Emoji Checks to confirm learner understanding and progress

## Prep

- Create the session files (pdf and zip) for distribution using `make generate-session-files f=module_name` or `make gsf-local f=module_name`
- Ensure you can authenticate to AWS using the correct credentials for the course (e.g. School of Tech, Generation, Client, etc.)

## Session

- Have AWS console and CLI ready to use
- Run the slide deck
- Demo the IaC yourself, show it working
- Run the exercises as breakouts, code-along(s) or live-shares as you see fit
