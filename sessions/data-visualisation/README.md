# Data Visualisation

We will understand the basics of data viz, why they're important and when to use them. The learners will receive a solid foundation for viz, along with learning how to create their own programmatically, using Jupyter Notebook and matplotlib.

## Overview

- Data Visualisation overview
- Chart types
- Jupyter Notebooks
- matplotlib

## Timings

- This session is timetabled for 2 blocks at 1.5 hrs each, i.e. 0.5 elapsed training days
    - Take your time with the description and discussions
    - Exercises pt1 "Setup Jupyter" can allow 15 mins
    - Matplotlib can allow 30 mins
    - Exercises part 2 "Use Jupyter" can allow 45+ mins
- The formative assessments occur during this and are included in that timing
- The exercises for this session (done in breakouts) are also included in that time

### Timings for SoT

On the 7 week course, we abbreviate this session to 1.5 hours.

- Be brief with the descriptions, the learners should have a Maths / Science background
- Exercises pt1 "Setup Jupyter" can allow 5 mins
- Skip Matplotlib completely
- Exercises part 2 "Use Jupyter" can allow 30 mins max

## Assessments

To check the learner progress in this session we have:

- Multiple Quizzes throughout the session with answer walkthrough
- Follow along demo for the students
- Set of exercises are ran in breakout room

## Prep

- Create the session files (pdf and zip) using `make generate-session-files f=module_name`
- Review the slides and exercises
- Have the exercise ready to distribute, which includes only the exercise file and the sql file (The CSV file is not for learners to use).
- Be prepared to have your own Jupyter Notebook ready

## Session

- Run the presentation
- Have Jupyter Notebook up and running
- Give learners plenty of time to try out making their own visualisations. You can choose to have them in pairs.
