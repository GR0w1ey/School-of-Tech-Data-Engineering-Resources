# To run the solution

1. Open a terminal in folder `solutions`
1. Activate your `venv`
1. Install our dependencies with
    1. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (MacOS / Unix)
    1. `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (Windows)
    1. `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (GitBash)
1. Open the file `solutions\solutions.ipynb` in VSCode
1. Use the "Run All" button
    1. You may need to choose a kernel to run on, use the same one you did for the exercises.

The file `Ill-never-let-go-jack.ipynb` is there to test the sample data (it's not part of the solution _per-se_).
