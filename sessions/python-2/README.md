# Python #2

This is the second part of the module, where we will be teaching the constructs of loops, dictionaries and functions.

It should be expected that all students can eventually get to grips with these concepts. Understandably there will need to be focus on letting learners try them out in code.

## Overview

- Loops
- Dictionaries
- Exceptions
- Functions
- Googling!

## Timings

- This session is timetabled for 6 blocks at 1.5 hrs each, i.e. 1.5 elapsed training days
- The formative assessments occur during this and are included in that timing
- The exercises for this session (done in breakouts) are also included in that time

## Assessments

To check the learner progress in this session we have:

- Quizzes
- Discussions
- Breakouts on Exercises
- End of week quiz (Week 2 - Python 2)

## Prep

- Create the session files (pdf and zip) using `make generate-session-files f=module_name`
- Review the slides and exercises

## Session

- Run the presentation
- This session is designed primarily as a code-along with the learners repeating everything on the slides for themselves in VSCode
- There are also exercises given out during the session, which work very well in breakouts of 3-ish learners helping each other, and the Instructor(s) dropping in to see who needs help and give encouragement
