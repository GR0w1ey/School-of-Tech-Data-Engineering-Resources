# Python #1

This is the first module of the course and is the starting point for all learners to understand the basics of programming, no matter how much they already know.

We want all students to feel comfortable with the language and get to a similar point of understanding across the board.

## Overview

- Basics of Computing
- The Python Programming Language
- Data Types
- Making Decisions
- Inputs and Outputs
- Logical Operators
- Questioning

## Timings

- This session is timetabled for 5 blocks at 1.5 hrs each, i.e. 1.25 elapsed training days
- The formative assessments occur during this and are included in that timing
- The exercises for this session (done in breakouts) are also included in that time

## Assessments

To check the learner progress in this session we have:

- Multiple Quizzes throughout the session with answer walkthrough
- Follow along demo for the students
- Set of exercises are ran in breakout room

## Prep

- Create the session files (pdf and zip) using `make generate-session-files f=module_name`
- Review the slides and exercises

## Session

- Run the presentation
- This session is designed primarily as a code-along with the learners repeating everything on the slides for themselves in VSCode
- There are also exercises given out during the session, which work very well in breakouts of 3-ish learners helping each other, and the Instructor(s) dropping in to see who needs help and give encouragement
