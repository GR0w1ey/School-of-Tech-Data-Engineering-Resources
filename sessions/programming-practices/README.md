An introduction to how we produce "good" code and what "good" means in this context.

## Overview

- Introduction to Programming Practices
- The Importance of Documentation
- Tech Debt and How to Reduce it

## Timings

- This session is timetabled for 1 block at 1.5 hrs
- The formative assessments occur during this and are included in that timing
- The exercises for this session (done in breakouts) are also included in that time

## Assessments

To check the learner progress in this session we have:

- Discussion of bad code samples
- Discussion of good code samples
- Quiz on Side Effects
- Discussion on Self-documenting code
- Quiz on variables
- Quiz on refactoring
- Emoji checks

## Prep

- Create the session files (pdf and zip) using `make generate-session-files f=module_name`
- Review the slides and exercises
- Consider approaching a member of the cohort beforehand and asking them to volunteer to have their project code base reviewed during the session before the exercise at the end.

## Session

1. Run the presentation
1. Run a live code review on your victim volunteer (that you pre-arranged)

## Project-time homework

1. Pair up the cohort to make a small change on each others repos and run a code review each way
