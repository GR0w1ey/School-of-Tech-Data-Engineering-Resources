### Git log

Make sure you have pushed any changes to your mini-project to your remote repository.

Today you will be using `git log` to look at a repository's commit history.

---

### Exercise

- Open your mini-project in VSCode.
- In the terminal, at the root of your project, type `git log`.
- Take a look through your commit history.
- If you wrote good commit messages, you will be able to understand what you did...
- ...were your commit messages meaningful?
- That's it!
