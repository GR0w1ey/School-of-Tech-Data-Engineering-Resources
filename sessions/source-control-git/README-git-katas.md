# git-kata-exercises

NOTE: All the git kata sessions use the source-control-git folder too. See [README.md](README.md)

## Prep

- Export the kata PDFs for distribution using `make docker-pdf-git-katas` or `make local-pdf-git-katas`.

## Sessions

- These exercises are intended to be used as daily katas over a period of several weeks.
- You should make sure that all the Academites are comfortable with the content of each exercise before moving on to the next one.
- It is a good idea to have an instructor run through the kata the Academites will be doing the next morning at the end of each day, and provide them with the instruction file (if it is a new exercise) at the same time. Give them the files one by one as they reach them, rather than all together at the start of the series.
