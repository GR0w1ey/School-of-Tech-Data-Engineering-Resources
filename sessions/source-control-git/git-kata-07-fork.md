## Git Kata 6

### Fork

---

### Forking a repository

Add, commit and push any changes from yesterday to your mini-project repository.

Today you will be forking a repository belonging to someone else. You can use forking to create a copy of someone else's repository, meaning that any changes you push to it will only affect your copy and not the original.

### Exercise

- Go to https://github.com/crobertsbmw/deckofcards
- Click on the `Fork` button on the top left
- Enter a name for your forked repository and click `Create fork`
- Clone the repository (the same way you did in exercise 6)
- In VSCode open one of the files in the repository and make a change
- Push your change to the remote
- Go back to your forked repository in the browser and check that it is there
- Go to the original repository. Your change should not be here
