## Git Kata 3

### Status

### The Status Command

Today you will be practicing using the `git status` command to check your changes between adding and committing them.

---

### Exercise

- In your terminal, navigate to your mini-project directory.
- Add your changes to your local repository.
- Use `git status` to check that all the changes you expect to have been added are present (and none that you did not expect).
    - Remember: staged changes will appear in <span style="color:green">green</span>, while unstaged changes will be <span style="color:red">red</span>.
- Commit your staged changes locally and then push them to the remote repository.
