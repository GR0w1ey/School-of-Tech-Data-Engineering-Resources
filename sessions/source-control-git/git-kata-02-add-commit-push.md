### Exercise

You should already have your mini-project repository set up on GitHub.

- In your terminal, navigate to your mini-project directory.
- Add your changes to your local repository using `git add file.js file2.js` or just `git add .`.
- Commit your staged changes locally: `git commit -m "<your_message>"`.
- Use `git push` to push your changes to the remote repository.
