# Databases-SoT Solutions

PostgreSQL Docker and Podman files are provided for running your database.

### To run the solutions

- First use the database setup scripts for podman/docker in the [../handouts/](../handouts/) folder as per [../handouts/README.md](../handouts/README.md)
- Then
    - open a terminal in the `solutions` folder
        - activate your venv as per [../handouts/README.md](../handouts/README.md)
    - run `python3 my_db_app_solution.py`
    - Some users may need to run `python` or `py` instead of `python3` as appropriate
