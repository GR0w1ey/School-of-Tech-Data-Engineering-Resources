# Example exercise

We have been asked to write a python function named `price_updater` with the following requirements:

It should receive 2 arguments, `prices` (list[float]) and `increase_rate` (float) and return the prices list with the same order and all values increased by the rate.

If the data type for any of the prices inside the price list is not float, return `Incorrect Price Detected!` as a string.

Constraints:

- 0 <= price <= 100,000
- 0 <= increase_factor <= 1

# Task

- make a function that has only `pass` in it in the existing file `maths_example.py`
- make unit tests for the `price_updater` function in the `test_maths_example.py` file
- fill in the function
