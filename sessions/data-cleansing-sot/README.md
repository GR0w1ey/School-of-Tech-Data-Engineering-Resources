## Data Cleansing (SoT)

This module introduces learners to the concept of data cleansing.

This session uses PostgreSQL as that is the engine running in RedShift, that we use in AWS.

## Overview

- Introduction to **Data Cleansing**
- Data quality
- Inspecting data
- How data is cleansed

## Timings

- This session is timetabled for 2 blocks at 1.5 hrs each, i.e. 0.5 elapsed training days
- The formative assessments occur during this and are included in that timing
- The exercises for this session (done in breakouts) are also included in that time

Typically, the exposition slides up to the exercise takes about an 1.0-1.5 hrs, depending on how much chit-chat there is.

The exercise section is quite long and depending on approach will take about 1.0-1.5 hours for many learners - in breakout rooms helping each other is best. For more advanced learners this can be as little as 30 mins.

Advanced learners who can complete the exercises should help those that are newer to coding.

## Assessments

To check the learner progress in this session we have:

- Quizzes
- Discussions
- Breakout room exercises

## Prep

- Create the session files (pdf and zip) using `make generate-session-files f=module_name`
- Review the slides and exercises

## Session

- Run the presentation
- Expect to finish the exposition / theory slides after approx. 1.5hrs and have approx 1.5hrs for the exercises
    - For more advanced learners this can be as little as 30 mins
    - Advanced learners who can complete the exercises should help those that are newer to coding
- The exercise(s) are good in breakouts of 3-5 people helping each other / collaborating

### Exercises in the Session

Needs Docker / Podman running - We need an Adminer and PostgreSQL container for the exercise code to connect to and save the data in.
