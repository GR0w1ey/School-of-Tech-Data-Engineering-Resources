## Data Encoding

---

### Overview

- What is data encoding and why do we do it?
- CSV
- XML
- JSON

---

### Learning Objectives

- To be able to explain what data encoding is and why we do it
- To gain an understanding of what CSV, XML & JSON are

---

### What is data encoding?

**Encoding** is the process of converting data into a specified format.

**Decoding** is the reverse process - to extract information from the converted format.

Common formats:

- JPG, MP4, AVI
- Morse code, Braille
- JSON, XML, CSV
- Analog, Digital

Notes:
The process of converting data into a format required for a number of information processing needs - e.g. transmission, storage.

During session - will learn about some of most common formats that data is stored in - will use in your career!

---

### Why do we encode data?

- Easier to store for computers (humans work with text, computers work with bytes)
- Removes redundancies from data (such as whitespace) so data size decreases
- Smaller data means it's more efficient to store and retrieve data

Notes:
We encode our data as a means of organizing our data.

Not about keeping information secret, but rather about ensuring that the data is able to be properly consumed - we're not encrypting.

---

### CSV (Comma Separated Values)

- A plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange **tabular** data
- Only contains text data
- Each line of the file is a data record
- Is separated by a _delimiter_ (comma, colon, tab etc.)

```csv
first_name, last_name, age
John,       Smith,     20
Sally,      Bloggs,    30
```

Notes:
Each encoding format has its own rules and special characters (reserved characters used for special purposes) - like human language, where we have grammatical rules and an alphabet.

Excel will allow you to convert from csv to xls (and vice-versa).

---

### CSV - Dealing with commas

What about data that contains a comma?

Well, in that scenario, we quote the data

```csv
first_name, last_name, age, test_scores
John,       Smith,     20,  "80, 76, 92"
Sally,      Bloggs,    30,  "72, 84, 90"
```

---

### CSV - Dealing with double quotes

How about data that contains a double quote?

We 'escape' the quote by using two of them together

```csv
tv,        size
"Samsung", "24"" TV"
"LG",      "41"" TV"
```

---

### CSV in Python

Luckily for us, Python has its own [csv library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) to read and write to/from CSV files.

---

### CSV - Reading a File

Looking back to the previous module, opening a CSV can be done in a few lines like so:

```py
import csv

with open('people.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=',')
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

`reader` is a function in the CSV library which returns an object which will iterate over the lines in the given file.

---

### Reading to a Dictionary

We can read our CSV directly into a dictionary using `DictReader`:

```py
import csv
with open('people.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_file = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in csv_file:
        print(row)
```

Output:

```py
{'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Smith', 'age:' 20}
{'first_name': 'Sally', 'last_name': 'Bloggs', 'age:' 30}
```

---

### CSV - Writing to a File

```py
import csv

with open('people.csv', mode='w') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter=',')

    writer.writerow(['Joe', 'Bloggs', 40])
    writer.writerow(['Jane', 'Smith', 50])
```

---

### Writing from a Dictionary to CSV

```py
with open('people.csv', mode='w') as file:
    fieldnames = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'age']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerow({
        'first_name': 'Jan',
        'last_name': 'Smith',
        'age': 60
    })
```

`fieldnames` is required when writing from dictionary to csv.

### XML

- Stands for 'Extensible Markup Language'
- Like HTML but for storing data rather than displaying data
- Multidimensional
- A form of semi-structured data

Notes:
Both HTML and XML are XML markup languages that are designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable.

XML documents can be validated against a schema (constrain which elements & attributes may be used & their allowable parent/child relationships).

Semi-structured because data does not reside in fixed fields or records, but does contain elements that can separate data into various hierarchies.

---

### XML Example

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<people>
  <person>
    <first_name>John</first_name>
    <last_name>Cole</last_name>
    <age>20</age>
  </person>
  <person>
    <first_name>Sally</first_name>
    <last_name>Bloggs</last_name>
    <age>30</age>
  </person>
</people>
```

Notes:
First line is the XML declaration - not mandatory.

Tags - start and end for elements (content shown in between).

Attributes are designed to contain data related to a specific element.

---

### XML Advantages

- Can store highly structured data
- Human readable
- Well understood and used

---

### XML Disadvantages

- 'Wordy' - metadata takes up a lot of space
- Becomes progressively inefficient the more complicated the structure of the data

Notes:
An element links to metadata by referencing each applicable metadata element's ID in inherited attributes.

### JSON

- JavaScript Object Notation
- A file format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects
- Can also store semi-structured data like XML
- Also maps to multidimensional data
- Can hold any combination of objects using `{}` and lists using `[]`

Notes:
Lightweight data interchange format.

Easy for humans to read and write.

Easy for machines to parse (taking a big lump and breaking into meaningful chunks) and generate.

Based on Javascript, but completely language independent.

---

### JSON Example - Object

JSON objects start with `{` and end with `}`. JSON files often contain a root object, like so:

```json
{
  "person": {
    "first_name": "John"
  }
}
```

<aside class="notes">
  Key/Value pairs separated by ':'.

  Different pairs separated by ','.

  Key is a string in double quotes.

  Value can be string, boolean, another JSON object, an array or null.

  JSON objects are surrounded in {}.

  Arrays are surrounded in [].
</aside>

---

### JSON Example - List

JSON lists start with `[` and end with `]`. JSON files can contain lists, like so:

```json
[
    {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Smith"
    },
    {
        "first_name": "Sally",
        "last_name": "Matthews"
    }
]
```

This would be analogous to the CSV data we saw before. The above would be a valid json file.

<aside class="notes">
  Key/Value pairs separated by ':'.

  Different pairs separated by ','.

  Key is a string in double quotes.

  Value can be string, boolean, another JSON object, an array or null.

  JSON objects are surrounded in {}.

  Arrays are surrounded in [].
</aside>

---

### JSON Example

JSON files can be arbitrarily complex, depending on your needs; This would be analogous to the XML example we saw before:

```json
{
  "people": [
    {
      "person": {
        "first_name": "John"
      }
    },
    {
      "person": {
        "first_name": "Sally"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:
Key/Value pairs separated by ':'.

Different pairs separated by ','.

Key is a string in double quotes.

Value can be string, boolean, another JSON object, an array or null.

JSON objects are surrounded in {}.

Arrays are surrounded in [].

---

### JSON Example - Code

```py
import json

person = {
    "name": "Rob",
    "phone": 123456
}
# encode & write to a file
with open('example.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(person, f)
```

```py
# read file and decode its content
with open('example.json', 'r') as f:
    my_data = json.load(f)
```

---

### Python objects and their equivalent conversion to JSON

| <span style="color:green">Python</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         | <span style="color:red">JSON Equivalent</span>  |
| :---------------- | :--------------: |
| dict              | object          |
| str               | string          |
| list, tuple       | array           |
| int, float        | number          |
| True              | true            |
| False             | false           |
| None              | null            |

---

### JSON Advantages

- Human readable and much less wordy than XML
- Has become a data transfer and storage "standard"

---

### JSON Disadvantages

- JSON isn't as robust a data structure as XML is.
- Can't use comments

Notes:
JSON has become the standard because its simple design and flexibility makes it easy to read and understand. Also easy to manipulate in the programming language of your choice.

No ability to add comments or attribute tags, which limits ability to annotate data structure or add useful metadata.

### Terms and Definitions - recap

**CSV**: A delimited text file that uses commas to separate values.

**XML**: a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

**JSON**: An open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value).

---

### Terms and Definitions - recap

**Encoding**: A system of rules to convert information into another form for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium.
