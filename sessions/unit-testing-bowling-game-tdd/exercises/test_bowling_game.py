# pytest code goes here
#
# Add a test for scenario one, then add code in file "bowling_game.py"
#
# If it helps - you may add a blank (empty) placeholder function and import it so your test compiles (but still fails when run).
#
# Only after the test compiles, runs, and fails, should you add any "useful" code in your function
